# Algorithm Problems

I created this repository to store and solve problems I encounter when working with algorithms using C++ and Python. These problems are part of the **Algorithm Lessons** from Picsart Academy.

## Contents
- Solutions in C++
- Solutions in Python
- Notes and explanations for algorithmic concepts

## Purpose
This repository serves as:
1. A collection of solutions for algorithm problems.
2. A reference for improving my problem-solving skills.
3. A resource for others learning algorithms.

Feel free to explore and use the solutions provided here!
